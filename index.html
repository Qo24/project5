            Established in 2021, IUS Wolves are the first team in Bosnia and Herzegovina that has managed to succesfully copy the american sports system in terms of basketball. For our first official season we are competing in the Bosnian A2 League South Division and our goal is to slowly and steadily climb the rankings and go into more seriously ranked leagues in Bosnia such as A1 League and Premier League.

        <h2>Our story</h2><hr class="hr">
        <p>
            Even though this is the first offical season of our basketball club, the idea of forming it was there for a much longer period of time than most of the people know. Even though this was finalized in 2021 the project regarding the club began in 2019 when two second year students came up with an idea to form a basketball club where only students of the University would be able to play. The idea and the plan was going great and our first squad was prepared to play an exibition game which was intended to be played at campus in order to get more eyes on the club. However, a day before the game was supposed to be played COVID-19 was introduced to the world and with it the first lockdown of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This resulted in clubs activities being pushed back along with the idea of playing the 2020 season. However, even that couldn't have stopped our two students Mirnes Mesanovic and Ahmed Plasto to persever with their idea and after the long 2 years their idea came into existence.
